Comp 2526 Assignment #1b

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: 

You are to develop a program that prints out the multiplication or addition table given the 
users start and end range and type of table. This time several classes will be used. See 
Assignment #1a for further details.

You are free to add more methods as you see fit – but all the methods listed below must be 
used in your solution.

For the classes AdditionTable and MultiplicationTable (separate files) the following methods 
should be made:

Constructor – takes in start and end positions
public void display() – displays table
private void createTable() – creates table

You will need to create an enumerated type (separate file) for the table types.
